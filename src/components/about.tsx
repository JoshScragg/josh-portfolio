        I've always had an interest in computers, but it wasn't untill i began playing video games did i really find my interest in programming.
        Seeing people cheat in games i always wondered how, so i started learning how to break the games i was playing from there 
        i was hooked, and as i leanred how to break things i began to understand how things worked and instead of breaking things fell in love width
        creating. The fact that i could take any idea i had and make it a reality always astonished me, and is the reason i continue to be obsessed 
        with this field.
