      I've always been into computers, but it wasn't until I got deep into gaming that I really discovered programming. I'd see players modifying games and got super curious about how that stuff worked behind the scenes. So I started tinkering with games myself, figuring out how to bend the rules a bit.

What started as me just messing around with game systems turned into something way cooler - I actually began understanding how software is built. Before long, I was more interested in creating my own stuff than breaking existing things. There's something mind-blowing about taking random ideas from my head and turning them into something real through code. That feeling still gets me every time, and it's why I'm still obsessed with this whole field.
